🔥 System Architecture

1️⃣ User requests a ride – Request is handled by the Flask backend.
2️⃣ Ride is assigned dynamically – The system uses geolocation and demand-based pricing.
3️⃣ LightGBM pricing model – Calculates fares dynamically.
4️⃣ Real-time updates via Kafka – Driver assignment, status updates, and notifications are handled asynchronously.
5️⃣ Optimized performance – Redis caching speeds up session retrieval and database queries.
6️⃣ Deployed on AWS – Ensures 99.9% uptime and seamless scaling.
